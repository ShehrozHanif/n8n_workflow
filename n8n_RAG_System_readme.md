# 🧠 Workflow Name: `n8n_RAG_System`

This is a **complete Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system built inside **n8n**, designed to connect a **chat interface** (user input) with **AI models (Google Gemini + OpenAI)** and **vector database (Pinecone)** for **context-aware answers** from private data — in your case, a **CV or document**.

---

## ⚙️ Step-by-Step Breakdown

### **1️⃣ When Chat Message Received**

**Node:** `When chat message received`

* This is your **entry point** — the workflow triggers whenever a user sends a **message** (like through a chatbot interface connected to n8n).
* It acts as a webhook waiting for user input.

🟢 **Purpose:** Starts the AI conversation automatically whenever a message arrives.

---

### **2️⃣ AI Agent**

**Node:** `AI Agent`

* The central brain of the workflow.
* It decides *what to do* with the user’s message — whether to respond directly, retrieve data, or query an external tool (like Pinecone).
* It connects with:

  * **Google Gemini Chat Model (LLM)**
  * **Simple Memory**
  * **Vector Store Tool**

🧠 **Think of it as the “orchestrator”** that coordinates between the model, memory, and document search.

🟢 **Purpose:** Handles reasoning, routing, and generating intelligent replies.

---

### **3️⃣ Google Gemini Chat Model**

**Node:** `Google Gemini Chat Model`

* This is the **LLM** (Language Model) used to understand and respond to messages.
* It’s the **main chat engine** that powers the conversation.
* Uses your **Google Gemini (PaLM)** API credentials.

🟢 **Purpose:** Generates natural, context-aware language responses.

---

### **4️⃣ Simple Memory**

**Node:** `Simple Memory`

* Keeps a **short-term memory window** of the conversation (context window = 10).
* Allows the chatbot to remember recent messages in the chat.

🟢 **Purpose:** Gives the chatbot conversational memory — it can recall what was just said and respond coherently.

---

### **5️⃣ Answer Questions with a Vector Store**

**Node:** `Answer questions with a vector store1`

* This node connects the AI agent to your **document knowledge base** (like a CV, manual, or dataset stored in Pinecone).
* It’s described as:

  > “It’s a CV of a person”
* So this tool is used when the AI needs to answer **document-based queries** (e.g., “What skills does Shehroz have?” or “What’s his experience in cloud?”).

🟢 **Purpose:** Enables **document-aware Q&A** — pulling answers directly from your CV’s embeddings.

---

### **6️⃣ Pinecone Vector Store**

**Node:** `Pinecone Vector Store`

* This is where your document embeddings are stored (vectorized form of your CV).
* It’s connected to the **sample2** Pinecone index.
* When queried, it retrieves the **most relevant chunks** of your document related to the question.

🟢 **Purpose:** Provides the R in RAG — *Retrieval*. It finds the right info before the model generates an answer.

---

### **7️⃣ Embeddings OpenAI**

**Node:** `Embeddings OpenAI`

* Uses OpenAI to generate **embeddings** — numerical representations of your document’s text.
* These embeddings are what allow Pinecone to perform **semantic search** (searching by meaning, not keywords).

🟢 **Purpose:** Transforms raw text into machine-understandable vectors for smarter retrieval.

---

### **8️⃣ Google Gemini Chat Model 2**

**Node:** `Google Gemini Chat Model2`

* Another instance of Gemini, used inside the **Vector Store Tool** for response generation once relevant document data has been retrieved.
* Basically, this model handles **contextual answering** after Pinecone provides the relevant data.

🟢 **Purpose:** Combines AI + context to generate final, document-based answers.

---

## 🔁 Workflow Logic (Simplified Flow)

```
User Message → AI Agent → (Memory + Gemini + Pinecone)
        ↓
If answer needs data → Query Pinecone (via Embeddings)
        ↓
Retrieve relevant document chunks
        ↓
Gemini + Vector Store → Generate contextual answer
        ↓
Send response back to user
```

---

## 💡 **What This Workflow Does (in Plain English)**

This workflow acts like a **smart chatbot that truly knows your documents**.
It doesn’t just use general AI knowledge — it **retrieves information from your uploaded files (like your CV)** and gives accurate, personalized answers.

Example:

> You: “What certifications does Shehroz have?”
> Bot: “Shehroz is certified in AWS Cloud Practitioner and Azure Fundamentals.”

That’s Retrieval-Augmented Generation in action. 🚀

🚀 **I Just Built an AI That Can Read My Resume — and Actually Talk About It!** 🤯💬

A few nights ago, I had one of those *crazy tech moments*.
I asked myself — *what if my CV could answer questions like a real person?* 😏

So, I opened **n8n**, and built a complete **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** workflow — powered by **Google Gemini**, **OpenAI**, and **Pinecone**.

Now my resume literally **talks back**. 🧠📄

---

### ⚙️ What’s Happening Behind The Scenes

🧩 **Step 1 — The Chat Trigger:**
Whenever I send a message like “What cloud certifications do I have?”, the workflow wakes up instantly.

🧩 **Step 2 — The AI Agent:**
Acts as the “brain.” It decides whether to answer from memory, from context, or to go dig through my stored knowledge.

🧩 **Step 3 — Google Gemini:**
Handles all conversation and reasoning — turns my messages into meaningful context.

🧩 **Step 4 — OpenAI Embeddings + Pinecone:**
My resume text is converted into *vectors* (mathematical meaning of words).
These vectors are stored in **Pinecone**, a high-speed vector database.
When I ask something, it retrieves the **most relevant part** of my resume before Gemini responds.

🧩 **Step 5 — Memory Buffer:**
Keeps track of the last few messages — so my chatbot doesn’t forget what we were talking about.

🧩 **Step 6 — Final Response:**
Gemini takes the retrieved data from Pinecone, adds context from memory, and replies like a professional assistant.

---

💬 **Example:**

> Me: “What are my strengths as a cloud specialist?”
> AI: “You have strong experience with AWS and Azure, certified in both, and specialize in scalable cloud architecture.”

Yes — my **AI literally knows my CV**. 🤖💼

---

### ⚡ Why This Is Powerful

This isn’t just automation — it’s **knowledge in motion**.
You can use this same setup to:

* Build a **recruiter chatbot** that answers from your CV.
* Create an **AI knowledge assistant** for your company docs.
* Power **smart search** for any private data source.

All **without writing a single line of code**.
Just **n8n + OpenAI + Gemini + Pinecone = Magic. 🪄**

🔥 I’m calling it: *The Future of Chatbots Is Personal + Contextual.*
