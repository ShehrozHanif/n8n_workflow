---

### 4️⃣ **Split Out (Topic Distributor)**

**Node:** `Split Out`

Each topic will become one **section** in the newsletter.

💡 Think of it as dividing your newsletter into “mini articles”.

---

### 5️⃣ **Tavily Search (Deep Research for Each Topic)**

**Node:** `Search1`
For each topic (e.g., “Boost Business with AI”), it:

* Includes raw content for context

🟢 **Purpose:** Provides background info for the writing agent.

---

🧠 Acts as a **professional writer** who:

* Reads the sources
* Writes one **newsletter section (350–500 words)**

📰 Example Output:

```
## Boost Business with AI  
Small businesses are finding innovative ways to scale using AI tools... [1][2]  
Sources:  
[1] Forbes — forbes.com  
[2] Washington Tech — washingtontechnology.com
```

---

### 7️⃣ **Aggregate (Combine Sections)**

It:

* Adds a “Key Sources” list
* Creates a friendly **sign-off**
* Applies inline CSS for readability

🟢 **Purpose:** Converts raw text into a polished, ready-to-send HTML newsletter.

---

### 9️⃣ **Structured Output Parser**

**Node:** `Structured Output Parser1`
Ensures the final output has only:

* `subject`: The email subject line

✅ Ensures clean formatting for Gmail.

---

### 🔟 **Gmail (Draft Creator)**

**Node:** `Create a draft`
Automatically creates a **draft email** in your Gmail account with:
